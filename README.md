# Poetry Example Shared Repository
During our time to practice in class, try to do the following:
- Create a file using your username as the filename, and put a little poem in that file
- add / commit / push your new file to this repository
- Try to edit the **poem_**.txt file for your section. Only edit the line number corresponding to
  the workstation number that you're sitting at. Try to add / commit / push your changes
